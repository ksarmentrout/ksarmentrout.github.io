The alpha version of [FlipHelper](http://www.fliphelper.io) is up and running! I started this project in late August and announced it here
in [this post](/post/fliphelper_1) in September, mostly for just personal accountability to get something out
there. I've had little time to work on it, but I finally got a presentable version up online!

So what does it do? It's a smarter way to look up how things are selling on eBay, specifically for the purpose
of reselling items at garage sales, thrift stores, etc. Once you enter an item and the asking price, it tells
you at what prices the maching search results have been selling recently, and what the current going rates are.
Based on what the asking price of your item is (i.e. what you would need to buy it for before reselling), it
tells you whether or not the difference in price would make it worth trying to re-sell.  

This is definitely an alpha version at the moment. The basic functionality is there, but I have a LOT more in 
mind to expand it! But for now, [enjoy](http://www.fliphelper.io)!
