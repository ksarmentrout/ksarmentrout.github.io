In [the previous post](/post/techstars_week_2/), I talked not about the main parts of Mentor Madness, but rather the tools
I developed in order to make the scheduling more manageable and automated. I've decided that there are so many facets to the Mentor Madness experience that it doesn't make sense to reflect on full weeks. Instead, I'm breaking them up into smaller, thematically related posts. This one is about the things to keep in mind when approaching Mentor Madness (and potentially other mentor meetings as well).

### Preparing for Mentors 

---

Leading up to Mentor Madness, there were a few rules that were discussed regarding how to make the most of the meetings. I'll go through a few and then give some general thoughts. 

<br/>

#### Rule 1: In a half hour meeting, you speak for 5 minutes, they speak for 25.

This first one was stressed the most. You want to quickly make your pitch and get to the meat of the discussion. Try to get as much value as you can from the mentor in 30 minutes. The meeting length was strictly enforced by the stationed Associate notetaker/timekeeper, so there was no getting back any wasted time. 

Some companies did better than others at this, but overall no one came close to keeping themselves to 5 minutes. To their credit, it's very hard to do. Generally the mentor has never heard of you before, and when you're the CEO, it's difficult not to go on about the company you've built. This is especially true when the mentor is genuinely interested and has a background relevant enough to ask deep questions. 

Admittedly, 5 minutes is an ambitious mark to hit, but the spirit of the rule is dead on. The most productive meetings I witnessed were those in which the companies efficiently laid out what they do, where they stand as a team, and what help they need from the mentor, all within the first 10 minutes. Control the direction of the conversation. The meetings where the mentor asked the founders detailed questions about the product were still very interesting, but the companies would find themselves with only a few minutes left without having asked anything of the mentors. 

<br/>

#### Rule 2: Have specific asks.

This rule follows closely from Rule 1 and compliments it well. Once you've spent your first 5 minutes describing your product, team, fundraising, etc., the best way to guide the conversation and get the mentor talking is to ask specific questions. 

These specific questions can be in a range of forms, depending on what that mentor brings to the table (and also what role he is playing, e.g. potential investor vs. hands-off advice giver). The key thing is that they have to be bounded to some relatively narrow scope. Asking for an intro to a specific person and asking for feedback on how the company is currently filling the top of their sales funnel are two very different questions, but both equally valid examples of this. 

<br/>

#### Rule 3: Be vulnerable.

Don't go into a meeting pretending everything is fine if it's not. You shouldn't spend your time bemoaning all your problems and making your company out to be an active trainwreck, but if you have a weak area or a problem that needs fixing, be open about it. Beginning a conversation by expressing where exactly you need help will provide context for your specific asks and let the mentor know how they can contribute.

<br/>

#### Rule 4: Prepare broadly categorized lists of questions and bring them to each meeting.

So how do you come up with the specific asks? Prepare them ahead of time by thinking about all the challenges your company is facing and where you have uncertainty. Categorize the questions into broad lists. Something like "Technical," "Sales/Marketing," and "Fundraising" might be examples, but they'll change based on your company's structure and needs. 

Bring those with you to the meeting. All of them, with the category most relevant to the mentor's background on top. If you know that this mentor knows so-and-so and you'd like an intro, or that their VC invested in GreatCo (or worse, RivalCo) and you want to know more, then great. Ask those specific questions! But if not or if you run out, the sheet you'll have with you is a great fallback point that will keep the conversation moving. 

A few companies did this, but it seemed that a lot of them didn't want to ask the same questions across different meetings. If you're going into a lot of meetings, it can actually be very helpful to refer to these pages often. That way you get a variety of responses to the same question and can weigh them against each other.

<br/>

#### Rule 5: Do your homework on the mentors.

Knowing something about the mentor's background going in to the meeting will go along way toward making the meeting as effective as possible. Mentor Madness is such a whirlwind that the companies often didn't have time to do their full due dilligence on each mentor, and often would just know the general space a mentor comes from. That's when the sheets from Rule 4 come in and do very well. 

Though the more background knowlege, the better (to a point! Don't be creepy about it!). Knowing some of the specifics of a mentor's history or who some of their portfolio companies are if they're a VC can help you come up with individualized questions for them. Of course, in this circumstance, it's also acceptable to ask the mentor for a quick bio, so you can identify how they can help.

<br/>

#### Disclaimers / Caveats

There can definitely be some exceptions to Rule 1, most notably if you and the mentor have great chemistry and hit it off very well. In that kind of situation, it can be very worth it to chat with them and get to know them a bit. This can be more likely to lead to follow-up meetings and working together more in the future. The strictness of Rule 1 is best served only when you know that a follow-up meeting is unlikely and you need to get as much value as possible from them within the allotted time. 

A lot of the advice above is also only really applicable to Mentor Madness, where you're meeting a lot of people back-to-back. If you've set up a meeting directly with someone well in advance, you should have time to do homework and have a reason for meeting that person. The sheets in Rule 4 may still work, but their worth is probably more in their creation so you know what questions you have, rather than something you'll need to rely on within the meeting.

### Overall

---

These guidelines will help get the most value out of a mentor or potential mentor within a short timeframe. It has been interesting to see how the companies have moved toward these types of techniques over the past few weeks.

This has barely scratched the surface of the Mentor Madness experience though, so more posts to come!
