Flipping garage sale or yard sale finds has long been touted as a good way to make extra money, or even 
as a full-time job. But for those of us who might only be garage sale "weekend warriors" and don't have the
time or expertise to develop an instinct for what might sell or what would even be worth trying, I'm building
a tool to make those decisions simpler.

FlipHelper is a web app for looking up recent sale prices and current going prices of objects on eBay and 
other online marketplaces. It will report stats and make a recommendation about whether or not the item you're 
looking at would be worth buying and listing, based on the asking price of the object and its market activity.

This is currently a work in progress, but there will be more updates to come, and I'm hoping for an 
initial launch soon! Got to make it presentable first.
