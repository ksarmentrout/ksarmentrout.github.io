Phew. I'm writing my week 1 review post on Tuesday night on week 2, which should 
give an indication of how busy this program is keeping me. 

It all began last Monday! The rest of the teams that hadn't moved in early all arrived
and we held orientation for the first day, complete with ice breakers. A lot of week 1
from the Associates' point of view was about getting a sense of the companies and 
feeling out how the work flow would be. We each scheduled meetings with the companies
to identify projects they could use help in and find the specific pain points they 
are tackling. Naturally the tech people and business people held different meetings 
with the CTOs, CEOs, etc., and we all kind of loosely gravitated toward those companies 
that aligned with our backgrounds. In my case, it resulted in approaching some of the 
biotech companies (Nix and BrainSpec! They were formally announced, so I can name names!),
which I hope to do work for throughout this program.

Though one of the great things is that every company has a variety of facets to the 
puzzles they need to solve day in and day out. Even 
one like Alice's Table, which offers a very non-technical product, has their own technical
challenges to solve. 

My to-do list is growing far more rapidly than I'm able to check off items. It's really
like drinking from a firehose in terms of how many projects there are to tackle
and how much incredible company-specific information there is to quickly become proficient with.

Overall, this week has been characterized largely by the feeling of everything starting
to settle into place. Despite some companies having been here for a week, the real 
meetings to hash out project details have begun in earnest now, and it has been a process
of everyone to get to know each other. There have already been some serendipitous and
spontaneous discussions between companies in which they discovered that they could help
each other in unforeseen ways. When two groups innovating in different spaces come together,
it's incredible how sharing technical strategies or just fresh viewpoints can lead
to new ideas. I have a feeling that this type of communal spirit and openness could
really help a company that finds itself in a rut with a partiular idea.

I've been working on a few projects for companies, but also getting ready for Mentor
Madness that begins (and as of this writing, _began_) on Feb. 13th. I'm taking point
on scheduling along with another associate, and I've been creating a bot to help automate
some of the tasks like notifying companies and associates when their schedules change,
sending out daily and weekly schedules to all teams, generating the daily schedules for
each specific mentor, etc. When there are 13 teams, 11 associates, 150+ mentors, 5
simultaneous meeting rooms, and a total span of 3 weeks... that's a lot of meetings.

It's strange writing a week 1 recap now that I'm in week 2, so I'll hopefully try to 
get the next one out on time. If for no other reason than to get an accurate snapshot of
my time for me to look back on. But for now I'll just mention that the days are _long_. 
Voluntarily long, because there is nothing strictly forcing us to go in to the office on
weekends or work later than 5 besides the volume of work to get done, but still long. I 
haven't been this busy before in my life, but I'm very much enjoying the challenge. More 
on Mentor Madness next week, and it is madness.
