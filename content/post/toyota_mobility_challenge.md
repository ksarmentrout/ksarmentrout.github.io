Today I participated in the "Toyota Mobility Challenge" put on by Toyota (obviously), and Net Impact here at Duke. The main
idea behind this kind of event is for students to come in and spend a day tackling large problems in a short time span by
quickly iterating through the process of idea generation from identifying the problem through to describing a prototype.
Meanwhile, they are provided with oversight and advice from industry professionals in the field, a timeline dictating the
movement through development stages, and snacks. From the students' point of view, it's a good opportunity to practice
being engineers/businesspeople/developers/inventors with instant feedback. From the company's point of view, "hey, free
ideas!" So it's a win-win, albeit slightly one-sided. 

This was the first of these that I've done, and I didn't really know what to expect from it. Honestly, I wasn't expecting
much. I participated in Duke's hackathon, aptly named HackDuke, last semester, but that was on an entirely different level
and seemed much more student-driven and open-ended. Going into this event, it just seemed too... corporate. There were
documents prepared outlining different "personas," which were short descriptions of people facing a spectrum of transport-
related difficulties, from an elderly ex-butcher who wanted to visit his shop but was confused by public transit to a woman
with the tagline "aspiring bike commuter." 

I arrived and met my team, which had like the others been intentionally diversified. My team included a Master of Planning
graduate student, a sophomore studying business, a Master of Engineering Management graduate student, and myself, a 
biomedical engineer. The first two came from UNC. Overall, we seemed pretty well-rounded. We were also assigned to be 
Green Team, which I thought boded well for an event with an implicitly eco-friendly slant. 

Overall, I found myself very much enjoying the process. The framework we were working within all day was very rigid (down
to the minute), where there was a separate and defined task for each time interval. The first hour or so focused on really getting
under the skin and into the mind of the single "persona" we selected (who in our case was Tim, a working single dad with
kids who was heavily reliant on his car) in order to determine how he feels, what he thinks, and what challenges he
faces. We then spent time thinking of several "How might we..." (HMW) questions to get at how might we construct a better x,
or make a better way for Tim to do y. Once we got these on the table, we settled on one and then used "Yes, and...", the
cornerstone of improv comedy, to rapid-fire generate as many solutions as we could for the problem. No matter how ridiculous
they end up being, every thought goes on a sticky note and on the wall ("Yeah, Tim could maximize space in his
small car by having his children parasail behind him! Even better if they can hold things while they're up there!").
From there, the ideas were pruned down, combined, and refined until a final concept was chosen, which was then
made into a rapid prototype and pitched to the judges.

Team Green had a few solid ideas (better than the parasailing idea, I promise), and even more good discussions. I won't go
into what our final concept was and we didn't end up winning, but I actually got a lot out of going through that process.
I was surprised by how many ideas could be generated in such a short time just by the iterative process of bouncing thoughts
between team members and by asking the right questions. A concept the event moderator stressed several times was about
framing the question, and making sure that you're answering the right one. That isn't something that I've thought a lot about
before, but looking back on today, I can see how it can really ring true. Drilling down into an issue and the needs surrounding
it to get to a single good question can be worth a lot more than lobbing too many ideas listlessly toward the issue's
general direction. I really appreciated that exercise today, and I'll look into doing more in the future.
