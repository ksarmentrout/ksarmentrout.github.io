### I've shipped up to Boston. 
I arrived about 10 days ago to take a job as a Data Scientist Associate
for the Techstars spring class. I'm hoping to provide a weekly update summarizing
my experience and the things I've learned. 

So far: **Week 0**! So called not only because any programmer worth their salt
starts indexing at 0, but also because the program hasn't officially started.
I've been in the office all week doing work for the early move-in companies
and getting oriented. 

One of my first thoughts: I am going to learn a LOT here. 

The entire cohort of companies hasn't arrived yet, but those that have are so 
driven and capable. Late evenings in the office seem to be the order of the day 
here, but not out of any kind of competitive desire to be the person working the
latest in some insane method of self-validation. 

Rather, the coworking space provided
at the CIC lends itself to easy productivity and the environment created by putting
a lot of entrepreneurs in one room is one of a communal desire for team betterment.
I know that even if only one company were here, the team members would be keeping 
the same schedule. There's a pervasive feeling of commitment to working hard and 
building the best company possible. 

And that's just from the companies! The top-down influence from the program directors
is the same. The explicit mentorship hasn't begun in earnest (because the program 
hasn't started yet), but the directors are all driven, idea-filled individuals,
who so far have inspired myself and the companies to do more, faster. 

Reflections from week 0:

### Success is about continual improvement

PhDs often have very specific domain knowlege, but can and do get jobs outside of 
their narrow fields of expertise because they must have acquired a set of 
skills in order to complete the PhD. These are mainly centered on independent research and 
learning. 

The same can be said about startups, who live in the scrappy, bootstrapped version of 
the corporate world outside academia. When you're on a team of two, for example,
there are bound to be gaps in your knowledge, which you must quickly
make up in order to stay afloat. Being confident in your ability to do this is 
necessary to succeed and continue contributing to the company. My 3-month tenure
here at Techstars is going to be full of learning on the job and rolling with the 
punches. 

### Give first

It seems a bit like a cop-out by naming one of Techstars' main tenets as a 
takeaway from the week, but it really is a productive and useful mindset to have.   

This has been validated not only by Techstars, but also by Venture Cafe, which is
organized around the same premise. An ecosystem of people with unique talents, all 
willing to build connections and collaborate with others, is 
a powerful thing and can lead to development in unexpected directions. 

Beginning conversations and attending networking events with the mindset of "how can I help 
this person?" or "what can I bring to the table here?" will make your interactions
more genuine. 

I've found this already from working with one of the startups at Techstars.
My background doesn't necessarily align with their main business plan, but by earnestly
offering the technical skills I have, I was able to work on a small project for the 
founder and learn more about the company while doing so. At the end, they appreciated
my work, and I can go to them in the future with a better understanding of what they
do and how best I am able to help them. That connection is a lot more valuable than 
if I had written off the company as not within my area of prior expertise and had 
thus only superficially gotten to know the founder.

### Mentorship is extremely valuable

The first month of Techstars is dubbed "Mentor Madness" because it's centered around
moving a large volume of local entrepreneurs, VCs, etc. through the doors and talking
with the cohort. This grants startups access to decades of experience and connections, 
very quickly.

There was one mentor in today, and already some of the startups are reaping the rewards,
from serendipitous past connections to advice moving forward. I can't wait to see 
how much the startups progress after a month's worth of additional mentors has come through. 

Mentors grant experience (something that young founders lack, almost by definition) and
often connections. Both are invaluable to secure when growing, so seeking a mentor who has
worked in a relevant field is well worth the time and outreach.

### Email etiquite matters

One of the first things covered in the workshops was how to ask for an intro. This and
some of the related lessons made me immediately re-think the job hunting strategy I had 
been using last semester and made me aware of the holes in my approach.

Knowing how to close the loop on introductions, write emails with the goal of making
the recipient do as little work as possible, and respond after interviews or meetings
are invaluable skills that aren't generally taught outside of business school.

### Overall 

I'm anticipating using this program to make myself more effective in 
any work environment I find myself in, learn a lot about technical work and the day-to-day
requirements of a startup, and improve myself based on the mentorship of my peers.

I'm so excited to get started.
