I am a current graduate student at Duke University pursuing an MS degree in biomedical engineering, after previously
earning a BA in neuroscience at Washington University in St. Louis. I am a creator at heart, and I enjoy thinking about 
and taking on new challenges (like building this website!). In my free time I play music and salsa dance\*; in fact,
you can find me out dancing here in Durham most weeks. 

As I work on projects, I will do my best to prepare updates on [my blog](/blog/home/). There you'll find my current project, an 
EEG-based control device, with more to come in the future. 

Please feel free to contact me via email or check out my LinkedIn/Github pages with the links below.

I also love traveling! The pictures on this site were taken during my semester abroad at University College London.
