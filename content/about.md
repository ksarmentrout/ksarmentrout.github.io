I am a current Data Science & Tech Associate at Techstars Boston, where I'm combining my enthusiasm for biotech, software
development, and entrepreneurship to assist the spring cohort of startups. Previously, I earned an MS in biomedical
engineering from Duke University and a BA in neuroscience at Washington University in St. Louis. I am a creator at heart, 
and I enjoy thinking about and taking on new challenges (like building this website!). In my free time I play music and salsa dance\*. In fact,
you can find me out dancing here in Boston most weeks. 

As I work on projects, I will do my best to prepare updates on [my blog](/blog/home/). 

Please feel free to contact me via email or check out my LinkedIn/Github/Twitter pages with the links above and below.
